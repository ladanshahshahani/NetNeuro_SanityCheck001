%This function uses parabolic interpolation to find the lag using the
%extremum of the lagged cross correlation.

%The function first uses the
%sign of the cross correlation at zero to decide whether to find a maximum
%or minmum. Next, we look for the global max/min.

%lcc is the empirical lagged covariance curve, lags is a vector with the timepoints in each temporal direction (e.g. -8:2:8 for +/- 8 seconds with a 2 second TR). 
%I have set a boundary condition such that any lag greater than 5 seconds is recorded as a NaN-- this is based on our experience that giant lags tend to be noise. You can relax or abolish this 
%boundary condition if you like.
